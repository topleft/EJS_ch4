Yet another old piece of script I am commiting inorder to practice the 
command line and git. As it turns out I am also practicing my typing with
all these README file that I am creating.

This peice of JavaScript is a recursive function that returns a list. Which,
to my understanding isn't a list like in ruby or Python. It is objects nested 
within objects. The key is an inde number and the value is the next object.
